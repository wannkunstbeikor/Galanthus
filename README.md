A Library for working with Files from Massive's Snowdrop Game Engine.

## Disclaimer

Some games require an aes/des encryption key and iv, I can't provide those because of legal reasons.
Please **don't** ask me or anywhere on this page for it.

## Oodle

Some games use oodle compression. Since oodle is ass and not opensource I can't include it in this program, that's why you need to acquire it from somewhere and place it into the ThirdParty directory with the name oo2core.dll.
On linux I included linoodle, so if you have a linux native library you can replace the existing one, else just add a windows one.
